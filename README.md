## How to use

### Quick start

1. [Create an account on DatoCMS](https://datocms.com).

2. Make sure that you have set up the [Github integration on Vercel](https://vercel.com/docs/git/vercel-for-github).

3. Let DatoCMS set everything up for you clicking this button below:

[![Deploy with DatoCMS](https://dashboard.datocms.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://dashboard.datocms.com/deploy?repo=datocms%2Fastro-starter-kit%3Amain)

### Local setup

Once the setup of the project and repo is done, clone the repo locally.

#### Set up environment variables

Copy the sample .env file:

```bash
cp .env.local.example .env
```

In your DatoCMS' project, go to the **Settings** menu at the top and click **API tokens**.

Copy the values of the following tokens into the specified environment variable:

- `DATOCMS_PUBLISHED_CONTENT_CDA_TOKEN`: CDA Only (Published)
- `DATOCMS_DRAFT_CONTENT_CDA_TOKEN`: CDA Only (Draft)
- `DATOCMS_CMA_TOKEN`: CMA Only (Admin)

Then set both `SECRET_API_TOKEN` and `SIGNED_COOKIE_JWT_SECRET` by generating two different secure strings (you can use `openssl rand -hex 32` or any other cryptographically-secure random string generator):

- The `SECRET_API_TOKEN` will be used to safeguard all API routes from incoming requests from untrusted sources;
- The `SIGNED_COOKIE_JWT_SECRET` will be used to sign the Draft Mode cookies.

#### Run your project locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Your website should be up and running on [http://localhost:4321](http://localhost:4321)!

## VS Code

The repository relies on the DatoCMS CLI to regenerate `schema.ts`; rerun `npm run generate-schema` after schema changes to keep type helpers up to date.
