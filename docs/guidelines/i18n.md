scope: How supports multi-language websites with localised routing, localised content and translations

# Internationalization (i18n)

This project is intentionally mono-locale. Every page is authored in Italian, each HTML document sets `<html lang="it">`, and no routing, helper, or CMS model supports locale switching. As part of the November 2025 scope change, Multimage confirmed that additional languages are out of scope for the foreseeable future.

## What this means for the codebase
- GraphQL queries should continue to omit `locale` arguments; all data comes from the default DatoCMS locale.
- Static routes (e.g., `/libri`, `/autori`) and dynamic routes (e.g., `/libri/[slug]`) never receive a `[locale]` param, so keep filenames and URL helpers Italian-only.
- When documentation or tooling mentions i18n (for example historical references in prompts), treat it as legacy guidance that no longer applies.

## Routing & canonical URLs
- `BaseLayout.astro` hard-codes `<html lang="it">` and renders `<Seo />` with `_seoMetaTags` coming from DatoCMS. There are no `<link rel="alternate" hreflang>` tags because only one locale exists.
- Canonicals are driven by whichever slug the current Italian record exposes. If editors override the canonical inside the CMS it should still point to the Italian URL rendered today.
- When adding new routes, verify they map to Italian slugs in `src/lib/datocms/recordInfo.ts` so preview links keep working.

## Editorial workflow
- Editors manage a single Italian copy for every model. If a translation is ever required for marketing purposes, publish it as independent Italian content (e.g., bilingual paragraphs within the same field) rather than building infrastructure for locale variants.
- Structured Text blocks should continue to store Italian prose; bilingual sections can live inside the same field separated by headings.
- If branded copy must mention English titles, include both languages inside the same field instead of cloning the record.

## Missing copy detection & fallbacks
- TypeScript helpers (`formatAuthorNames`, `AUTHOR_NAME_FALLBACK`, `withFallbackSeo`) already surface Italian defaults when CMS content is missing. Rely on those utilities instead of adding per-component fallbacks.
- For SEO, `withFallbackSeo` injects Italian title/description strings whenever `_seoMetaTags` omit them. Keep those fallbacks up to date so crawlers never read English placeholders.
- Avoid importing translation libraries (`astro-i18next`, `@lingui/*`, etc.) to prevent unused dependencies from creeping back in.

## RTL & accessibility considerations
- Because the site is permanently Italian, directionality stays `ltr`. If a future page embeds RTL quotations, wrap them in `<span dir="rtl">` manually; there is no global RTL toggle.
- Keep accessibility in mind: continue testing with Italian-language screen readers and ensure `lang="it"` remains on `<html>` whenever you touch `BaseLayout`.

## QA checklist
- Smoke-test key flows (home, `/libri/[slug]`, `/magazine/[slug]`, `/cerca`) to confirm the UI, meta tags, and aria labels remain in Italian after content changes.
- Before shipping schema updates, confirm the DatoCMS “default locale” stays Italian so new fields do not introduce accidental English placeholders.
