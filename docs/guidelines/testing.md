# Testing

Fastro is a website with very poor dynamic parts. Most of it is static site.
So testing is just about code formatting and build before pushing the repo

You can run the unit tests with the following command:

```bash
npm run test
```

Via `run-p test:*` it will run several check:

- format
- lint
- build
