# Preview, Draft Mode & Visual Editing

Multimage runs as a **single Astro project on Vercel** with `output: 'server'`
and ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration). Anonymous visitors get
CDN-cached responses (effectively static); editors with the draft cookie bypass
the CDN and see live draft content with click-to-edit overlays.

Le architetture precedenti (due progetti Vercel separati con `SERVER=static` e
`SERVER=preview`) sono state ritirate il 2026-05-17 con la shape
`2026-05-16-unify-projects-isr.md`.

## 1. Architecture overview

```
Anonymous visitor → Vercel CDN → cached response (no function invocation)

Editor (draft cookies) → Vercel CDN sees __prerender_bypass cookie
                       → bypass cache → function runs SSR
                       → executeQuery uses draft token + contentLink:'v1'
                       → page rendered with stega-encoded text
                       → ContentLink client enables click-to-edit overlay

DatoCMS publish → webhook → /api/revalidate
                          → parses payload (api_key + slug)
                          → maps to the affected URLs only (surgical)
                          → fetches each with x-prerender-revalidate header
                          → CDN regenerates + recaches
                          → buildTriggers.reindex → Site Search re-spidered
                            (no rebuild, no cache impact)
```

### Cookies that drive draft mode (dual-cookie pattern)

When `/api/draft-mode/enable` runs, the app sets **two cookies**:

| Cookie | Role | Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `multimage_draft_mode` (configurable via `DRAFT_MODE_COOKIE_NAME`) | App-level auth. The site reads this to know the editor is authenticated and to switch to the draft CDA token. | Signed JWT (`SIGNED_COOKIE_JWT_SECRET`) with payload `{ enabled: true }`. |
| `__prerender_bypass` | CDN-level cache bypass. Vercel recognizes this cookie name natively and forces the request to bypass the ISR cache. | Plain opaque token equal to `BYPASS_TOKEN`. |

Both cookies are required. The disable endpoint deletes both.

## 2. Required environment variables

Set every variable in this table both locally (`.env`) and on Vercel for every
environment (Production / Preview).

| Variable | Required | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `DATOCMS_PUBLISHED_CONTENT_CDA_TOKEN` | yes | Published-only CDA token. |
| `DATOCMS_DRAFT_CONTENT_CDA_TOKEN` | yes | Draft-only CDA token (must include "Access in Preview Mode"). |
| `DATOCMS_CMA_TOKEN` | yes (only if SEO Analysis plugin is enabled) | CMA token for `/api/seo-analysis`. |
| `SECRET_API_TOKEN` | yes | Shared secret for `/api/preview`, `/api/draft-mode/enable`, `/api/preview-links`, `/api/revalidate`. |
| `SIGNED_COOKIE_JWT_SECRET` | yes | Random string used to sign the draft JWT cookie (`openssl rand -hex 32`). |
| `DRAFT_MODE_COOKIE_NAME` | optional | Defaults to `multimage_draft_mode`. |
| `BYPASS_TOKEN` | yes on Vercel | Opaque token used both as the `__prerender_bypass` cookie value (Draft Mode) and as the `x-prerender-revalidate` header (on-demand ISR via `/api/revalidate`). Generate with `openssl rand -hex 32`. |
| `DATOCMS_BASE_EDITING_URL` | yes for Visual Editing | **Bare admin URL with no `/environments/...` suffix**: `https://multimage.admin.datocms.com`. Used by Content Link to construct edit-URLs. ⚠️ Appending `/environments/main` (even though `main` *is* the primary) makes the stega edit-URLs take the *sandbox* form, and the plugin then reports "Environment Mismatch Detected" — the sandbox URL shape doesn't match a primary-environment editing session. Only append `/environments/<name>` when targeting a genuine non-primary sandbox. |
| `PUBLIC_DATOCMS_SITE_SEARCH_API_TOKEN` | yes | Site Search token (ships to the browser — must be read-only Site Search scope). |
| `PUBLIC_SITE_URL` | yes | Site origin without trailing slash. |

The `SERVER` env var has been **removed**. Do not set it anywhere.

## 3. Draft mode flow

Editors enter preview through one of:

- The **DatoCMS Web Previews** plugin sidebar in DatoCMS — clicks "Draft version".
  The plugin hits `/api/preview-links?token=...` (no manual setup beyond
  installing the plugin via `/api/post-deploy`). Each preview link goes through
  `/api/draft-mode/enable?redirect=<recordUrl>&token=...` so both cookies are
  set, then redirects to the record page.
- A direct call to `/api/preview?secret=<SECRET_API_TOKEN>&redirect=/percorso`
  (useful for manual smoke tests).

Exiting preview is automatic when the plugin emits a "Published version" link
(it calls `/api/draft-mode/disable`). Manual exit:
`/api/draft-mode/disable?redirect=/percorso`.

## 4. Draft data flow

- `src/lib/datocms/executeQuery.ts` reads `includeDrafts` from the call site and
  automatically swaps the CDA token. In draft mode it also opts into Content
  Link (`contentLink: 'v1'` + `baseEditingUrl: DATOCMS_BASE_EDITING_URL`) so the
  CDA returns stega-encoded text the overlay can attach to.
- Pages call `resolveDraftMode(Astro)` (from `~/lib/draftPreview`) to know
  whether the current request is in draft mode and forward the flag to
  `executeQuery({ includeDrafts })`.
- `DraftModeQueryListener` (in `src/components/DraftModeQueryListener/`)
  subscribes to live updates: when DatoCMS emits an update for the same query,
  the listener reloads the data with stega encoding preserved. The component
  short-circuits (renders nothing) outside draft mode.

## 5. Visual Editing (Content Link)

Outside draft mode, Content Link is fully inert: the CDA response contains no
stega encoding, so the overlay never activates.

Inside draft mode:

- `src/components/ContentLink.astro` is mounted by `BaseLayout` and initializes
  `createController().enableClickToEdit()` on the client.
- Click on any block or text rendered from a structured-text field → DatoCMS
  opens the corresponding field (in a new tab when the site is loaded outside
  the plugin, in a side panel when loaded inside the **Visual** tab of the Web
  Previews plugin).
- 8 custom Structured Text block components carry the
  `data-datocms-content-link-boundary` attribute on their root element so the
  overlay can target each block as a unit.

The plugin's "Visual" tab loads the site inside an iframe. To make that work,
`src/middleware.ts` adds a `Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors ...` header
to draft-mode responses only.

⚠️ The Visual tab **nests** iframes — `admin.multimage.org` (the admin app)
frames `plugins-cdn.datocms.com` (the plugin), which frames the site. CSP
`frame-ancestors` validates the *whole* ancestor chain, so listing only
`plugins-cdn.datocms.com` is not enough: the browser shows "refused to connect".
The header therefore allows `'self' https://*.datocms.com
https://admin.multimage.org`. The custom admin domain (`admin.multimage.org`)
must be listed explicitly — the `*.datocms.com` wildcard does **not** match it.

## 6. On-demand cache invalidation (webhook)

DatoCMS publish → webhook → `POST /api/revalidate?token=<SECRET_API_TOKEN>`.

The endpoint does **surgical** revalidation (since 2026-06-20 — see
`docs/decision-log/2026-06-20-fot-reduction.md`):

1. Validates the secret.
2. Parses the webhook payload (`src/lib/datocms/webhookPayload.ts`): the
   `event_type`, the record `slug` (`entity.attributes.slug`), and the model
   `api_key` (from `related_entities`, referenced by
   `entity.relationships.item_type`).
3. Maps `api_key + slug` to the small set of affected URLs via
   `getRevalidationUrls()` (`src/lib/datocms/revalidationUrls.ts`): the record's
   own detail URL + a bounded set of listings. A **book** change also revalidates
   the catalogue pages (`/libri` + `/libri/pagina/2..N`), the book sub-indexes,
   `/`, `/sitemap.xml`, and the detail pages of its authors and collection
   (resolved with one CDA query). Typically ~12–20 URLs for a book, fewer for
   other models. Unknown / unmapped models → **no-op** (logs and returns 200).
4. Fetches each URL with `x-prerender-revalidate: <BYPASS_TOKEN>` in chunks of
   20 in parallel, with a 250 ms pause between chunks (stays under the DatoCMS
   40 req/sec rate limit).
5. Triggers a **Site Search re-index** (`buildTriggers.reindex`) — re-spiders
   the search index with no rebuild and no ISR cache impact. Best-effort: a
   failure is logged but does not fail the revalidation. No-op unless both
   `DATOCMS_CMA_TOKEN` and `SITE_SEARCH_BUILD_TRIGGER_ID` (currently `37696`)
   are set.
6. Logs mode/total/success/failures, elapsed time, the revalidated `urls`, and
   the reindex result to `vercel logs`. The JSON response echoes the `urls`.

`POST /api/revalidate?mode=full` still runs the whole-surface sweep via
`getAllPublicUrls()` (manual maintenance / emergency). The old in-memory 5 s
debounce was removed: surgical calls are cheap and idempotent, and a debounce
would wrongly drop a second distinct record published within the window.

### Cache TTL (safety net)

`astro.config.mjs` sets `isr.expiration` to **60 days**. This is only a safety
net: content changes propagate on-demand through the webhook above, so the TTL
just covers the rare case of a missed/failed webhook. A short TTL was pure waste
— it re-rendered the whole surface roughly weekly for unchanged content, burning
Fast Origin Transfer. A manual Vercel build or `?mode=full` forces a full refresh
anytime.

### The DatoCMS webhook (configured)

A webhook named **"Revalidate site cache (ISR)"** (id `33942`) is configured on
the project:

- **URL**: `https://www.multimage.org/api/revalidate?token=<SECRET_API_TOKEN>`
- **Events**: `item` → `publish`, `unpublish`, `delete`. `update` is **not**
  triggered on purpose — saving a draft does not change what the public sees, so
  there is nothing to invalidate until the record is actually published.
- **auto_retry**: on (DatoCMS retries on transient failures).

The "invalidate everything" strategy (rather than mapping a record to only its
dependent pages) is a deliberate decision from the shape: a book appears on its
own page *and* in the home, lists, author/collection pages, so a full sweep is
simpler and guarantees nothing stays stale. The cost is ~669 CDA reads per
publish, accepted during shaping.

To recreate it via CLI: `npx datocms cma:call webhooks create --data='{...}'`
with the events above (see the shape doc for the full payload).

## 7. Local development

`npm run dev` runs `astro dev`. ISR caching is a Vercel CDN feature, not active
locally — every request is SSR'd. Draft mode works via the JWT cookie (visit
`/api/preview?secret=...&redirect=/`). Content Link works locally if
`DATOCMS_BASE_EDITING_URL` is set in `.env`.

`/api/revalidate` works locally but the `fetch` calls hit `PUBLIC_SITE_URL`
(production), so it's effectively a no-op for local testing unless you point
`PUBLIC_SITE_URL` at a tunnel.

## 8. Troubleshooting

- **Editor sees published content despite cookies** → check both cookies are
  set in DevTools → Application → Cookies (the JWT cookie *and*
  `__prerender_bypass`). If only the JWT is set, `BYPASS_TOKEN` is probably
  missing from Vercel env, so `enableDraftMode` skipped setting the bypass
  cookie. The CDN serves the cached published response.
- **`/api/revalidate` returns 500 "BYPASS_TOKEN not configured"** → set
  `BYPASS_TOKEN` on Vercel (and re-deploy so the adapter picks it up).
- **Webhook fires but pages don't update** → check `vercel logs` for the
  `[revalidate]` lines. Most common cause is the `x-prerender-revalidate`
  header value not matching `bypassToken` configured in `astro.config.mjs`.
  Both must come from the same `BYPASS_TOKEN` env var.
- **Visual Editing overlay missing** → confirm `DATOCMS_BASE_EDITING_URL` is
  set. Without it `executeQuery` (and `DraftModeQueryListener`) skip Content
  Link entirely (`contentLink`/`baseEditingUrl` left `undefined`): drafts still
  render, just without the click-to-edit overlay. This is intentional — sending
  `contentLink: 'v1'` without a base URL makes the CDA 422
  (`INVALID_X_BASE_EDITING_URL_HEADER`), which used to break every draft page in
  local dev.
- **Iframe in DatoCMS "Visual" tab won't load / "refused to connect"** → check
  response headers for `Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors ...`. Two
  causes: (a) the header is absent — `isDraftModeEnabled` is resolving to
  `false` (missing/invalid JWT cookie); (b) the header is present but does not
  list the custom admin domain — `frame-ancestors` must include
  `https://admin.multimage.org`, not just `https://plugins-cdn.datocms.com`,
  because the ancestor chain includes the admin app (see §5).
- **Plugin shows "Environment Mismatch Detected" (records belong to sandbox
  `main`)** → `DATOCMS_BASE_EDITING_URL` has a `/environments/...` suffix. Remove
  it: the value must be the bare `https://multimage.admin.datocms.com` when
  editing the primary environment (see §2).
- **DatoCMS rate limit errors during webhook** → unlikely with current
  chunking (20 parallel × 250 ms pause ≈ 80 req/sec inbound, but each URL
  triggers 1–3 GraphQL calls so the burst can briefly exceed 40 req/sec).
  Increase `CHUNK_PAUSE_MS` in `src/pages/api/revalidate/index.ts` if you see
  429 errors.
- **Need to revoke editor access** → rotate `SECRET_API_TOKEN`,
  `SIGNED_COOKIE_JWT_SECRET`, and `BYPASS_TOKEN`. Editors with old cookies
  immediately stop receiving drafts; the cookies are still set in their
  browser but no longer recognized.
