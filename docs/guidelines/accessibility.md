# Accessibility (a11y)

## Best practices

aims to stay close to the web standards. Here's a few tips to help keep it accessible:

- Use semantic HTML as a baseline.
- Use [media queries for a11y](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_media_queries/Using_media_queries_for_accessibility) like `prefers-reduced-motion` and `prefers-contrast`.
- Use native elements for interaction like `<form>`s, `<label>`led `<input>`s, `<output>`s, `<dialog>`, `<details>` with `<summary>` and native API's like the [Popover API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Popover_API).
- Add relevant ARIA roles and attributes on custom interactive components.
- Require `alt` texts on assets in the CMS and use their value in templates.
