# Project Structure & Module Organization

## Components, models, graphql fragments

Il progetto deve avere una struttura simile a https://github.com/datocms/astro-website/tree/main/src/components/blocks/ShowcaseProjectBlock o https://github.com/datocms/astro-website/tree/main/src/pages/partners/%5BpartnerSlug%5D in cui ogni componente o ogni rotta ha:

- Un file \_graphql.ts in cui si trova la graphql dedicata
- un file index.astro che rappresenta il contenuto

dopodiché ogni query richiama i fragments necessari

```
 import { VideoPlayerFragment } from '~/components/VideoPlayer/graphql';
 inDepthExplanation {
          value
          links {
            ... on RecordInterface {
              id
              __typename
            }
            ...AcademyChapterLinkFragment
            ...AcademyCourseLinkFragment
            ...BlogPostLinkFragment
            ...ChangelogEntryLinkFragment
```

## Filesystem structure

Inside of this project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```

```

- `docs/` contains project documentation.
  - `decision-log/` lists all key decisions made during the project. Please read the log so you understand why decisions are made and document key decisions when you make them.
- `src/` contains all website source files that will be handled by Astro.
  - `pages/` - [Pages](https://docs.astro.build/en/core-concepts/astro-pages/) are organised by file system routing and are paired with GraphQL query files for data loading.
  - `pages/api/` - [API routes](https://docs.astro.build/en/core-concepts/endpoints/#server-endpoints-api-routes) are dynamic server endpoints with support for path & query params etc.
  - `components/` - [Components](https://docs.astro.build/en/core-concepts/astro-components/) are the elements the website is composed of. This can be Astro and framework specific components.
  - `blocks/` - Blocks are a specific set of components which have a complementary content [Block](https://www.datocms.com/docs/content-modelling/blocks) in DatoCMS and therefore have a paired GraphQL fragment file.
  - `layouts/` - [Layouts](https://docs.astro.build/en/core-concepts/layouts/) are Astro components used to provide a reusable UI structure, such as a page template.
  - `lib/` - Shared logic and utility helpers, like `datocms`, `i18n` and `routing`.
  - `assets/` - is for assets that require a build step. See [Assets](./assets.md).
- `public/` is for any static assets that are served as-is. See [Assets](./assets.md).
- `config/` bundles all our configuration files (like DatoCMS migrations), so the project root doesn't become too cluttered.
- `scripts/` contains all our custom CLI scripts, typically available via `package.json` > `scripts`. Also see [Commands](../README.md#commands).

## Architecture overview

- Astro 5.15 runs in fully static mode; every routed page is prerendered and
  wrapped by `src/layouts/BaseLayout.astro`, which fetches global navigation,
  favicon meta tags, and SEO defaults from DatoCMS at build time.
- Components follow the “`_graphql.ts` + `index.astro`” pairing mandated in
  AGENTS.md. Shared fragments live under `src/lib/datocms/commonFragments.ts`
  and are imported wherever a block or page needs them.
- All content flows through `src/lib/datocms/executeQuery.ts` using the server
  CDA tokens. No local content mirror exists, so GraphQL queries are the source
  of truth.

## Data flow & rendering

- Routed pages define their queries next to the template
  (`src/pages/libri/index/_graphql.ts`, etc.), map the result into view models
  with helpers (e.g., `mapBooksToCards` in `src/lib`), and hand the data to UI
  components.
- Layout requests such as menus and favicons are currently fetched per page.
  Consider caching if they become hot spots.
- Structured Text is rendered either via `@datocms/astro/StructuredText` or via
  `toRichTextHtml` for older fields. Work toward consolidating on Structured
  Text renderers to maintain consistent escaping.
- Client-side search ships a bespoke bundle generated by
  `scripts/build-search-client.mjs`, which talks to the Site Search API using
  the public token exposed through data attributes on `/cerca`.
- `src/pages/llms-full.txt.ts` reproduces the former export script entirely at
  build time, keeping the dataset in sync without extra manual commands.

## Build & deploy reminders

- `npm run sync-datocms` regenerates `schema.ts` and refreshes
  `docs/DATOCMS.md` whenever `DATOCMS_API_TOKEN` is available locally.
- `npm run prebuild` rebuilds the Site Search client ahead of `npm run build`,
  which itself runs `astro check` + production build.
- Vercel is the only supported deploy target; all automation and docs assume
  builds are promoted via the Vercel dashboard/CLI linked to this repository.
