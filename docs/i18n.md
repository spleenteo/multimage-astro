# i18n — Current State (2025-11-16)

- The site is permanently Italian-only (decision logged in docs/TODO.md task **I18N1**). There are no alternate locales, language switchers, or translated slugs.
- All URLs are canonicalized to `https://www.multimage.org` via `PUBLIC_SITE_URL`; no `hreflang` tags are emitted beyond the default `it-IT` meta.
- Content editors maintain Italian copy directly inside DatoCMS; there is no fallback to English.
- Future localization work is paused indefinitely; any change should be documented here alongside updates to `/docs/guidelines/i18n.md`.
