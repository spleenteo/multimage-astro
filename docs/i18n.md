scope: How supports multi-language websites with localised routing, localised content and translations

# Internationalization (i18n)

This project is intentionally mono-locale. Every page is authored in Italian, each HTML document sets `<html lang="it">`, and no routing, helper, or CMS model supports locale switching. As part of the November 2025 scope change, Multimage confirmed that additional languages are out of scope for the foreseeable future.

## What this means for the codebase
- GraphQL queries should continue to omit `locale` arguments; all data comes from the default DatoCMS locale.
- Do not introduce `[locale]` route segments, Rosetta catalogs, or alternate `<link rel="alternate" hreflang>` tags. Canonical URLs simply point to the Italian slug rendered today.
- When documentation or tooling mentions i18n (for example historical references in prompts), treat it as legacy guidance that no longer applies.

## Editorial workflow
- Editors manage a single Italian copy for every model. If a translation is ever required for marketing purposes, publish it as independent Italian content (e.g., bilingual paragraphs within the same field) rather than building infrastructure for locale variants.
- Keep accessibility in mind: continue testing with Italian-language screen readers and ensure `lang="it"` remains on `<html>`.

> This document exists solely to clarify that internationalization is **not** supported. If priorities shift, capture the new requirements in `docs/TODO.md` before reintroducing any localization work.
